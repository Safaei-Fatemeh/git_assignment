# Git Assignment - <Safaei-Fatemeh>

a. What is an issue?  
Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. In fact, It is a feature on GitHub that allows us to track requested changes and features in a software project.

b. What is a pull request?  
A pull request is a request to merge your changes into the main project, allowing others to review and discuss the changes.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?  
We have the following steps:

- Fork the Repository.  
- Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.  
- Create a New Branch: Create a new branch for your work.  
- Make Changes: Make the necessary changes in your branch.  
- Commit Changes: Commit your changes with a commit message.  
- Push to GitHub: Push your branch to GitHub.  
- Open Pull Request: Go to the repository on GitHub, and there is an option to compare and open a pull request. Click on it, provide a title and description for your pull request, and submit it.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)  
We have the following steps:

- Go to the Repository on GitHub.    
- Go to Settings (Click on the Settings tab in the repository).  
- Manage Access: In the Settings menu, click on Manage access.  
- Invite Collaborator: Click on the Invite a collaborator button.  
- Search for the User: Enter the GitHub username or email of the person you want to invite.  
- Set Permissions: Choose the level of access (for example, write permissions) you want to grant and send the invitation.  
- Collaborator Acceptance: The invited person will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation.  

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?  
I suppose Git is a version control system and it is a tool to track code changes locally. But, GitHub is a web-based platform to host Git repositories online for collaboration.

f. What does git diff do?  
It shows the differences between files in your project. It is useful for reviewing what has changed before committing or pushing changes.  

g. What is the main branch?  
The main branch is the default and primary branch in a Git repository.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?  
No, it is better to create a new branch, make changes, and open a pull request to merge them into the main branch.
